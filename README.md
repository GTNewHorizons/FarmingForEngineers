# Farming For Engineers 1.7.10

Aims to backport [FarmingForBlockheads](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farming-for-blockheads) to 1.7.10


## What works:
- UI and base mod functionality.
- Forestry integration.
- Market appearance (Model/Textures).
- Interacting with the NPC opens up the market UI.

## Untested:
- Custom trade entries.

## What doesn't work:
- ~~NPC doesn't have a proper model/texture.~~
- AI is broken.
- No sound effects.
- No particle effects.
- ~~Block doesn't rotate to face the player when placed.~~
  - Fixed by @Dioxop.
- ~~No block item.~~
  - ~~Seems to be the cause of the game crashes that happen when trying to craft the block or when opening the creative tab.~~
  - Fixed by @Dioxop.
